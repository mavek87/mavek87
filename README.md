### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matteo Veroni! 

<br><br>Passionate Java backend developer with a flair for DevOps practices and a love for building scalable applications. With a solid foundation in Java development and expertise in technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Gradle, Jenkins, and AWS Cloud, I thrive in crafting robust and efficient backend solutions. But that's not allâ€”my journey doesn't stop at the backend. I'm also well-versed in frontend development, particularly with React, adding a dynamic touch to my projects.<br><br>

ðŸš€ Let's connect and build something amazing together!<br><br>
